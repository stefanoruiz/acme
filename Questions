- What, in your opinion, is an important part of code reviews? That is, what is
  something you pay attention to when you review code, and that you appreciate
  when others do the same for your code?

Syntax and ease of code. The easier and more understandable it is the better. It's a two way street.
I always strive for clean and readable code. 


- We have an awful lot of computers here, and it gets pretty confusing with
  slightly different things running on all of them. How could containers help us
  improve this situation?

Version and differences in operating systems hinders workflow. Using containers makes it easier
to test across a variety of platforms without having to change the main code. Running a Linux distro
in a container rather than running a variety of OS's not only is it more straight forward but you also
avoid having different commands too.
